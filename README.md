My name is Ryan Weier, I'm a tech enthusiast, motor head, foodie, and movie goer

I have a background in a few different fields. Since I graduated high school I've worked as a Realtor, Personal Cruise Consultant, ACAD Draftsman, Cost Estimator, and a Digital Marketer.

My career goal is to become knowledgeable in Python, blockchain, and other technologies to the point where I can get a job in the fintech industry. I hope to work on some cool projects that are having a positive impact in people's lives while being part of this digital revolution as it pertains to finance. From there I would like to develop a project of my own that has utility for the everyday working person, making there lives much better and more streamlined in regards to payments and finance.
